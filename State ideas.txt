    Objective
    Commands to execute upon stage start (string array)
    Commands to execute at seconds remaining -> seconds -> string array
        The current game name should be a variable that can be used within commands (something like <game>)
        Commands should be able to contain value getters within <> (a key within the game state)

Stage names should have no effect on any behavior.

Initial stage (to allow restarting/preset).
